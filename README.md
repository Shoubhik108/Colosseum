# Colosseum

## üí° Inspiration

Due to COVID-19, we are disconnected from the outer world and we miss to got out and watch theatre and movies with our friends and family. We are in a situation where we can't do anything and we can't even go out and play with our friends. On the other hand the threater workers are losing their jobs and they are not getting enough money to pay for their living. So we decided to build a platform that will help them to get back to work and to get enough money to pay for their living and to get back to having fun with your friends and family.

## üíª What it does

Colosseum is a web application that allows you to create a new event to watch movies with friends or to join an public evet that is already created. It is a platform that allows you to create events and invite friends to watch movies together and chat along. Users can also join an event that is already created and donate some money to the event if they wish to(to motivate and help the event).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Node Js and Express Js: For backend
- MongoDB: For database
- Docker: For deployment
- Firebase: For authentication and storage
- Python & Tensorflow: For movie and show recommendations

## Best use of Google Cloud

- We are using Google Cloud for user authentication and storage. We have a lot of data to store and we need to be able to access it from anywhere. We are using Cloud Firestore for our data storage.

- We are using Google Cloud for movie and show recommendations. We are using Tensorflow for our model.

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- Majority of the team was working on the backend. We had to learn how to work with the backend and how to make it work.
- We also face some difficulty building the perfect recommendation system for the application.
- Completing the project in the given time frame.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Building a recommendation system for movies and shows.
- Creating a platform that allows users to create events and invite friends to watch movies together and chat along.
- Using Firebase for authentication and storage.
- Completing the project in just two days is another.

## üìñ What we learned

- We learned how to make a recommendation system for movies and shows.
- We learned how to use the backend to store and access data.
- We learned how to authenticate users using Firebase.

## üöÄ What's next for Colosseum

- Building an Admin Portal to handle all your events.
